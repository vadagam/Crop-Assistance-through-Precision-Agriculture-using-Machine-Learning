# Crop-Assistance-through-Precision-Agriculture-using-Machine-Learning
An agricultural crop recommendation system using machine learning can predict the best crop to grow in a specific area based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil type, crop properties, and previous crop yields. By using K-NN (K Nearest Neighbour) machine learning algorithm.
About the project:
Agriculture is a major area of the Indian economy. It is necessary for Indian economic growth
survival and expansion. India is a significant producer of many different agricultural goods. In the
process of cultivating crops, the soil is crucial. A non-renewable, dynamic natural resource
required for life is soil. Crop cultivation used to be done by farmers with practical experience.
Based on the properties and soil characteristics, farmers can no longer any longer able to select the
ideal crop. Hence, a recommendation system that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest the
crop that can be harvested in that specific soil has been developed.
Crop prediction properties help in defining multiple attributes in recommending an accurate crop
yield. The genotype, soil properties, climatic conditions, and certain environmental interfaces help
to develop a secured system of crop prediction.
Exiting System:
1. Statistical models: These models use historical data about crop yields, weather
patterns, and other factors to make predictions about future yields. The models are
based on statistical analysis.
2. Expert systems: These systems are based on the knowledge and experience of
agricultural experts, and use rules and decision trees to make predictions about crop
yields. Expert systems.
3. Agronomic models: These models use information about soil type, weather patterns,
and other factors to make predictions about crop yields. Agronomic models are based
on scientific principles.
Proposed system:
Machine learning is one of the key technologies used in precision agriculture to make
predictions about crop production. In crop prediction, machine learning algorithms are
used to analyze large amounts of data that are collected from various sources, such as
weather data, soil sensor readings, and historical crop production records. The
algorithms then make predictions about crop growth, yield, and quality, based on
patterns and correlations in the data. The user will be asked to give the crop attributes
where the required crop will be predicted as the outcome in the GUI.
